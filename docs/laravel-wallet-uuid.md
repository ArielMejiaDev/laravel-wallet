## Laravel Wallet UUID

## Composer

The recommended installation method is using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

In your project root just run:

```bash
composer req bavix/laravel-wallet-uuid
```

Now you need to migrate!

After migration, you can use the UUID in your models.
Attention! It will not work to use UUID instead of ID in wallet models; there is a special uuid field for this.

It worked!
